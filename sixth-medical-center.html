                    <h2>Saint G.Lusavorich Medical Center</h2>
                    <p>
                        The “St. Grigor Lusavorich” Medical Center is considered
                        one of the advanced medical centers in Armenia. Built in
                        1977, the Medical Center was founded by Academician
                        Suren K. Avdalbekian. Initially, the Hospital has been
                        known as Municipal Emergency Aid Hospital #2. In 1991
                        the Hospital was given a new name of the Emergency
                        Scientific Medical Center which incorporated also an
                        Emergency Care station of Yerevan city. Just in 1994,
                        the Emergency Care station was fully detached to become
                        a separate institution. Nevertheless, training and
                        methodical programs with the Emergency Scientific
                        Medical Center have been retained, and a great number of
                        the Emergency Care Station system specialists were also
                        embraced within the retraining courses arranged in
                        cooperation with advanced centers of the USA. For the
                        first time in Armenia and CIS, a large diversified
                        surgery-oriented hospital has been used to found up a
                        2nd grade Traumatic Center complied with international
                        standards. That entailed deployment of certain
                        surgery-oriented departments and opening up new ones. As
                        a diversified institution, the Medical Research Center
                        stood out for its active work in the days of the
                        disastrous earthquake and during Karabagh war, not only
                        having medical support set up on the spot, but also
                        sending physicians out in voluntary lines to render
                        medical assistance in the distant hospitals of the
                        country. Since 1992, the Medical Center managed by
                        Professor Ara M. Minasian is in a well-established
                        relationship in the sphere of working and training
                        programs with US Boston Medical Center and Massachusetts
                        Medical University. Supported by the above-mentioned
                        institutions, the Medical Center used its base (former
                        reanimation department) to set up the first in the
                        Republic emergency care and reanimation department, what
                        has fully altered and improved the situation with the
                        admission of badly injured patients waiting for
                        immediate intervention, and principal approaches worked
                        out to arrange medical treatment. In 1992 the
                        above-mentioned US Centers assisted their Armenian
                        partner to open up an Emergency Care Regional Training
                        Center which was upgraded to a Chair of Emergency Aid of
                        National Healthcare Institute in 1994. The Chair
                        cooperated with the US Centers to elaborate and deliver
                        some training courses for the intra-hospital and
                        hospital emergency care doctors, nurses and drivers. In
                        1997, collaboration with US Oakridge Radiation Center
                        experts resulted in processing still delivered first
                        regional training courses for preparation to such an
                        urgent regional issue as radiation disasters, resisting
                        to them and reduction of impending losses. The Hospital
                        and the Chair laid the foundation of a medical service
                        TV bridge, to have ties established between Armenian
                        regions and to give advice in necessary cases. The “St.
                        Grigor Lusavorich” Medical Center is a basis not only
                        for the Emergency Aid Chair but for 10 other Chairs of
                        National Healthcare Institute, as well as for the
                        Mkhitar Heraci State Medical University Chairs of
                        Therapy and Children’s Neurology. Тhe Medical Center has
                        1600 employees.
